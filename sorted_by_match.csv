It shrank from 31% in 2010, as revenue grew 88% but expenses grew 107%. Facebook's biggest cost?

Established as an Internet startup in 2008, the company is valued at $4.75 billion at present. Groupon made headlines last year when it rejected Google's offer to acquire the company for a hefty price tag of $6 billion. Another reason behind the hype was Korea's social commerce craze. Groupon allows people to make collective purchases at cheaper prices. The discounts only kick in when a set number of people agree to make the purchase, so interested buyers usually spread the word on social media sites.Lukewarm response?

In fact, a report for the Australia Institute says lonely people may use social media to find social support, but they have fewer Facebook friends and count fewer of them as 'real friends'. According to Australia Institute director and report author David Baker, quality, not quantity, of social connections is critical in determining loneliness. He says social media shouldn't be treated as a cure for loneliness, and online social contact may in fact mask real social disconnection. 'Given the rapid increase in the use of social media and the government's policy focus on 'social inclusion', there is a risk that social networking sites may be overpromoted, especially to younger people,' the Daily Telegraph quoted Baker as saying.",",isocial,iint,imed,",1340928000000,",austr,melb,apacz,ausnz,victor,",Have many Facebook friends?
